What if we could customize the whole process and also have access to a network of friends' menus, archive and access all former menus and also integrate past seasons? This might be a great tool to identify a picky customer's order, or to save progress on cocktail creations for the spring menu drop, or simply to find your next hit for your home cocktail party",

Ms Boisson hired me to fix up the website for her mother Judi's quilt and linen brand, which looked like it needed a bit of love and some fresh CSS. \nThe site was just down. Right away I discovered that it was built on Magento 1, and not running at all. The account information was lost, so without access to the codebase I couldn't simply restyle anything. Instead my work here was to help them find the right way to get the store back online. \nSo instead of migrating to Magento 2, I decided to have them make this a Shopify store, much more user friendly, especially if you're a small shop without a tech team handy. Here are the main steps we took for this:",
