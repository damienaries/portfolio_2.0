                    Concept is a social platform for human flourishing
                    built in JavaScript, React and Firebase. My role there
                    as a member of the startupâ€™s founding dev team was
                    distributed across the stack, with a Front-End focus to
                    build foundational features like a forum page and our
                    onboarding slides.

                    Before I made the decision to return to a previous career plan and learned to code, I enjoyed a long international career tending and running cocktail bars in Paris, NYC, Montreal, St Barts - and many other places. Those were good years that led me where I am today and I&apos;m always happy to talk about them.<br/>
                    As a developer, I bring along the solid work ethic and invaluable skills acquired through all these years of customer facing & team leading roles.
